#### <u>Levelling Passives</u>

#### **Pathing Tips**  

> - The passive skill tree allows flexibility. If you find yourself needing additional stats to equip better gear, consider grabbing nodes leading to future clusters.  

> - There are no huge mandatory power spikes that must be reached at all costs—take a flexible and strategic approach.  

> - The early game example shown in the screenshot (referenced below) is sufficient through Act 1-3 and focuses primarily on offensive clusters without heavy emphasis on survivability.

#### **When to Shift Priorities**  

> - Once you’ve reached most of your offensive minion clusters, focus on improving minion and player survivability.  

> - However, if you find yourself dying often, this could signal that you should assess your playstyle rather than just relying on passive tree changes.  

> - Adjust your passive priorities as you become familiar with the mechanics of combat and encounters.

#### Ascendancy Points
`As you progress through the game, you’ll earn Ascendancy points to allocate into your chosen Ascendancy skill tree. Here’s how you should approach these points for this build:`

> - The first 2 points should go into Summon Infernal Hound. This is your main meatshield and ignition source, offering both defensive and offensive support. It's a must-have early to ensure you can effectively mitigate damage while maintaining consistent pressure on enemies.  

> - The next 2 points can be allocated into Altered Flesh, depending on your late-game plans. Altered Flesh provides additional bonuses and scaling that can help with survivability if you decide to focus on scaling defensive or utility-based options later in the game.  

> - While these 2 points are not essential in the early game, they are a great choice if you plan for a longer-term scaling strategy. Always adapt based on your gear, playstyle, and objectives.
